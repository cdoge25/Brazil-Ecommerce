- Some of the late orders were due to the shipping unit(s), because the time to pickup an order was relatively fast but after that, the delivey was somehow delayed.
- Other sellers however had orders that were very slow to be picked up by the shipping unit(s). This might lie in the sellers' fault like products posted for sale are actually out of perhaps these orders require cross-border shipping, which resulted in late delivery time.
- All cities were relatively fast in the confirmation duration and pickup duration, untimely delivery was mostly due to the shipping unit(s).
### 2.3. Suggestion
- Contact the shipping unit(s) for cities with slow delivery time to adjust their operation.
- Improve customer service by urging the shipping unit(s) responsible for the late orders or provide customers that did not receive their package on time with compensation like vouchers or promotional offers.
- Look into sellers who had slow delivery time to see whether there were any problems occuring and help them resolve.
## 3. Payment
![](https://github.com/cdoge25/Brazil-Ecommerce/blob/main/dashboard/7.png)
- Half of the orders were paid in full immediately in the first month.
- Almost 90% of the orders had their payment finished in less the half a year.
- Orders which had 10 months in term to pay possessed higher valuee than other orders with lower terms, except orders that were paid in full immediately.

=> When paying in installments, customers must bear additional interest. The longer the term, the more money they have to pay. Therefore, except for some orders of fairly high value that are beyond the ability to pay immediately, customers will tend to complete the payment within 6 months.


- Payments via credit card is most common (nearly 75%).
- The least used form of payment is via debit card.

=> Normally, credit card is the most commonly used card for installment payment because no money is needed in the card, only the customer proof of income â€“ this benefits both the buyer and the seller.


- 5 product categories that are most likely paid in installments were: computers, small appliances for oven and coffee, kitchenwares, home appliances and home comfort.

=> These products has high value, long product life cycle so the average installments are also higher than other products.
